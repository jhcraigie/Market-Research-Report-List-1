<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Dryers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vented Electric Dryers</li><li>Ventless/Condenser Dryers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electric dryer market comprises two main types: vented electric dryers and ventless/condenser dryers. Vented electric dryers require a venting system to extract the hot and moist air from the dryer and release it outside the home. On the other hand, ventless/condenser dryers utilize a condensing system that cools the hot air, condenses the moisture into water, and collects it in a tank or drains it out. This eliminates the need for external venting, making ventless/condenser dryers a more flexible and convenient option for laundry spaces that lack proper venting infrastructure.</p></p>
