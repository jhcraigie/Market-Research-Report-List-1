<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Isolated RS-485 Transceivers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Operation Mode Half Duplex</li><li>Operation Mode Full Duplex</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Isolated RS-485 Transceivers market comprises two types of operation modes: half duplex and full duplex. In the half duplex mode, the communication can occur in two directions but only one at a time. This means that the transceiver can both transmit and receive data, but not simultaneously. On the other hand, in the full duplex mode, the transceiver allows simultaneous communication in both directions. This enables the transceiver to transmit and receive data simultaneously, enhancing the overall data transmission efficiency for certain applications.</p></p>
