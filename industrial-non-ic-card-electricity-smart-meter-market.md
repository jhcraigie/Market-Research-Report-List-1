<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Non-IC Card Electricity Smart Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Phase</li><li>Three Phase</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The industrial non-IC card electricity smart meter market includes two main types: single phase and three phase smart meters. Single phase smart meters are used in residential and small commercial buildings, where the electrical load is relatively low. They measure the electricity consumption in a single alternating current (AC) waveform. On the other hand, three phase smart meters are employed in larger commercial and industrial buildings, and they measure electricity consumption in three AC waveforms, providing more accurate and detailed data on energy usage. Overall, these smart meters enable efficient monitoring and management of electricity consumption in industrial settings.</p></p>
