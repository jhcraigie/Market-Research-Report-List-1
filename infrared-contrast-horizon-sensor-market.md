<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infrared Contrast Horizon Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Infrared Contrast Horizon Sensor</li><li>Passive Infrared Contrast Horizon Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Infrared contrast horizon sensors are used to detect and measure the contrast between objects and their backgrounds based on infrared radiation. There are two main types of infrared contrast horizon sensors: active and passive. Active sensors emit their own infrared radiation and measure the contrast when it reflects back, while passive sensors rely on the natural infrared radiation emitted by objects. Active sensors are useful in scenarios where there is low ambient infrared radiation, while passive sensors are suitable for environments with sufficient natural infrared radiation.</p></p>
