<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable Anaesthesia Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Flow Anesthesia Machines</li><li>Low Flow Anesthesia Machines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Portable anesthesia machines are medical devices used to administer anesthesia during surgery or other medical procedures. There are two main types of portable anesthesia machines: high flow and low flow machines.</p><p>High flow anesthesia machines deliver a constant flow of fresh gas to the patient's lungs, ensuring a high concentration of oxygen and anesthetic. These machines are suitable for longer, complex surgeries and provide precise control over the administered anesthesia.</p><p>In contrast, low flow anesthesia machines recycle a portion of the exhaled gases, resulting in a reduced consumption of anesthesia gases. These machines are more cost-effective and suitable for shorter surgeries or procedures where precise control over anesthetic levels is not required.</p></p>
