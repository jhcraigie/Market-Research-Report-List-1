<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Inkjet Printers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CIJ</li><li>DOD</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Industrial inkjet printers are categorized into two main types: Continuous Inkjet (CIJ) and Drop on Demand (DOD). CIJ printers use a continuous flow of ink through a nozzle, which creates individual droplets that are electrically charged and deflected to form the required text or image. DOD printers, on the other hand, emit drops of ink only when necessary, with each drop being more precisely controlled. Both types offer high-speed printing capabilities and find applications in various industries such as packaging, automotive, and textiles.</p></p>
