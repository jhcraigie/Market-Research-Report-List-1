<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Duct Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive</li><li>Positive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Passive fire duct systems are designed to contain fire and prevent its spread through a building's ventilation system. These systems use fire-resistant materials within the ductwork to restrict the movement of flames, smoke, and heat. They rely on the inherent properties of these materials to provide effective fire protection without the need for active mechanisms.</p><p>On the other hand, positive fire duct systems employ active measures to mitigate the risk of fire in ducts. This typically involves installing fire dampers that automatically close upon detecting smoke or heat, preventing the spread of fire through the ventilation system. Positive systems often incorporate smoke detectors and sophisticated control systems to ensure prompt response and containment.</p><p>Both passive and positive fire duct systems serve the purpose of enhancing fire safety within buildings, but they employ different approaches to achieve this goal.</p></p>
