Increasing prevalence of coronary heart diseases, growing geriatric population, and advancements in surgical techniques are some of the key factors driving market growth. Additionally, rising adoption of minimally invasive procedures and technological advancements in graft materials are further fueling market growth.</p><p>The market is also witnessing several trends that are shaping its growth. One such trend is the increasing preference for off-pump CABG surgeries, which are less invasive and associated with reduced complications and faster recovery. Moreover, the rising focus on developing bioabsorbable vascular grafts is gaining prominence in the market, as they eliminate the need for long-term antiplatelet therapy and reduce the risk of graft failure.</p><p>Furthermore, the market is witnessing a shift towards hybrid coronary revascularization procedures, which combine minimally invasive coronary artery stenting with bypass surgery. This approach offers advantages such as reduced surgical trauma, shorter hospital stays, and quicker recovery.</p><p>Overall, the coronary artery bypass grafts market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 10.1% during the forecast period. Factors such as the increasing prevalence of coronary heart disease and advancements in surgical techniques are expected to drive market growth. Additionally, trends such as the adoption of off-pump CABG surgeries and development of bioabsorbable vascular grafts are shaping the market's trajectory.</p></p>
