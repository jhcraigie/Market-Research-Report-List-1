<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Therapy in Oncology Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ex Vivo</li><li>In Vivo</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gene therapy in oncology refers to the use of genetic material to treat cancer. It can be carried out either ex vivo or in vivo. Ex vivo gene therapy involves the removal of cells from a patient's body, genetically modifying them in a laboratory, and then re-introducing them back into the patient. In contrast, in vivo gene therapy involves directly delivering the genetic material into the patient's body. Both types aim to modify the patient's cells to either destroy cancer cells or enhance the immune system's ability to fight against cancer.</p></p>
