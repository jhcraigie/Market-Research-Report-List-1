<p><h1>Human Liver Models Market: Challenges, Opportunities, and Growth Drivers and Major Market Players forecasted for period from 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Human Liver Models Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Human liver models are in vitro systems or artificial structures that mimic the structure and function of the human liver. These models are used in research, drug discovery and development, and toxicity testing. They provide a more cost-effective and ethically superior alternative to live animal testing.</p><p>The human liver models market is expected to show significant growth in the coming years. Factors driving this growth include the increasing demand for more accurate and reliable models for drug testing, the rising prevalence of liver diseases, and advancements in tissue engineering techniques. Additionally, the growing focus on personalized medicine and the need for better prediction of drug-induced liver injury also contribute to the market growth.</p><p>One of the latest trends in the human liver models market is the shift towards more complex and physiologically relevant models. Traditional two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures are being replaced by three-dimensional (3D) models that better mimic the liver microenvironment. These 3D models allow for enhanced cell-cell interactions, cell polarization, and improved liver-specific functions, making them more useful in drug discovery and toxicity testing.</p><p>Another trend is the use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to generate human liver models. iPSCs have the ability to differentiate into liver cells, enabling the development of patient-specific liver models for personalized medicine. This approach holds great promise for disease modeling, drug screening, and understanding liver development and function.</p><p>In conclusion, the human liver models market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.8% during the forecast period. This growth is driven by factors such as the demand for more accurate models, the prevalence of liver diseases, advancements in tissue engineering, and the shift towards complex and physiologically relevant models. The use of iPSCs is also a notable trend in this market.</p></p>
