<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The OCT Imaging System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Time-Domain Type</li><li>Spectral-Domain Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The OCT imaging system market is divided into two main types: Time-Domain Type and Spectral-Domain Type. </p><p>Time-Domain Type OCT imaging systems work by measuring the interference of light waves as they are reflected back from different layers of tissues. This type requires moving parts to scan the sample and is relatively slower compared to the other type. </p><p>On the other hand, Spectral-Domain Type OCT imaging systems use a spectrometer to measure the spectrum of light reflected from the sample. This type is faster, higher resolution, and does not require moving parts, making it preferred by many users.</p></p>
