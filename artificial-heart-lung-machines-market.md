<p><p>An artificial heart lung machine, also known as a cardiopulmonary bypass machine, is a medical device used during open-heart surgery to take over the functions of the heart and lungs. It temporarily oxygenates and circulates the patient's blood, allowing the surgeon to perform procedures on the heart and other vital organs while the patient's own heart is stopped.</p><p>The artificial heart lung machines market has witnessed considerable growth in recent years and is expected to continue growing at a CAGR of 9.4% during the forecast period. One of the key factors driving this growth is the increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, which require open-heart surgeries. The rising geriatric population, coupled with unhealthy lifestyle choices, has led to a surge in the number of cardiovascular diseases, thereby creating a demand for artificial heart lung machines.</p><p>Additionally, technological advancements in artificial heart lung machines have enhanced their efficiency and safety, further driving market growth. The incorporation of miniaturized components, improved oxygenators, and advanced monitoring systems has significantly improved patient outcomes and reduced the risk of complications during surgery.</p><p>Furthermore, the growing trend of minimally invasive surgeries is expected to boost the market for artificial heart lung machines. These machines are increasingly being used in minimally invasive cardiac procedures, such as robotic-assisted surgeries, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), and ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation. These less invasive procedures reduce the risk of infections, minimize scarring, and ensure faster recovery, thereby driving the demand for artificial heart lung machines.</p><p>In conclusion, the artificial heart lung machines market is poised to witness significant growth in the coming years due to the increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, technological advancements, and the growing trend of minimally invasive surgeries. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.4% during the forecast period.</p></p>
