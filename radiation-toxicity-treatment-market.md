<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiation Toxicity Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ionizing Radiation</li><li>Non-ionizing Radiation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radiation Toxicity Treatment Market Types can be classified into Ionizing Radiation and Non-ionizing Radiation. Ionizing Radiation refers to the type of radiation that carries enough energy to remove tightly bound electrons from atoms, resulting in the creation of ions, which can be harmful to living organisms. Non-ionizing Radiation, on the other hand, has lower energy levels and does not have enough potency to ionize atoms. Both types of radiation require specific treatment methods aimed at mitigating the effects of exposure and minimizing toxicity for affected individuals.</p></p>
