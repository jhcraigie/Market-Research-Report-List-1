<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wall Hung Combination Boilers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Condensing</li><li>Non-Condensing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wall hung combination boilers are a type of heating system that provides both hot water and heating. There are two main types of these boilers available in the market: condensing and non-condensing. </p><p>Condensing boilers are more energy efficient as they recover heat from the exhaust gases. They achieve this by condensing the water vapor present in the flue gases. This process helps to reduce energy wastage and lowers fuel consumption.</p><p>On the other hand, non-condensing boilers do not recover heat from the exhaust gases. They operate at lower efficiency levels compared to condensing boilers and therefore consume more fuel to provide the same level of heating.</p><p>Both market types exist to cater to different consumer needs, with condensing boilers being more environmentally-friendly and energy-efficient.</p></p>
