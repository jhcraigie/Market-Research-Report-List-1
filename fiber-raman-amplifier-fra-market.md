<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber Raman Amplifier (FRA) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lumped Type</li><li>Discrete Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Fiber Raman Amplifier (FRA) market offers two types of amplifiers: lumped type and discrete type. Lumped type amplifiers are compact devices that rely on discrete high-power lumped pump lasers to amplify the signal. They offer simplicity and cost-effectiveness for shorter distances. On the other hand, discrete type amplifiers utilize distributed Raman amplification along the fiber. They involve distributed pump lasers and provide higher power and longer transmission distances. Discrete type amplifiers are suitable for long-haul networks but are more complex and expensive than lumped type amplifiers.</p></p>
