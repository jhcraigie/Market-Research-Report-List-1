<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Floss Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Waxed Flosses</li><li>Unwaxed Floss</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dental floss market consists of two main types: waxed flosses and unwaxed floss. Waxed flosses are coated with a thin layer of wax, making them easier to slide between teeth and providing a smoother flossing experience. They are ideal for individuals with tight spaces between their teeth. On the other hand, unwaxed flosses lack the wax coating, making them thinner and more suitable for those with wider gaps between teeth or sensitive gums. Both types serve the purpose of effectively removing food particles and plaque to maintain good oral hygiene.</p></p>
