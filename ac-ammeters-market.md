<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AC Ammeters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Analog Ammeter</li><li>Digital Ammeter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>AC ammeters are used to measure alternating current in a circuit. There are two main types of AC ammeters: analog and digital. Analog ammeters use a moving coil mechanism, where the current passing through the coil causes a deflection on a scale, allowing the user to read the current value. On the other hand, digital ammeters use a digital display to provide a numerical reading of the current. While analog ammeters offer simplicity and a visual indication, digital ammeters provide precise measurements and may offer additional features like data logging.</p></p>
