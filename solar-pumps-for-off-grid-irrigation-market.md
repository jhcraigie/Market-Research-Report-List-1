<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Pumps for Off-grid Irrigation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Submersible</li><li>Surface Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solar pumps for off-grid irrigation are divided into two main types: submersible pumps and surface pumps. Submersible pumps are placed deep within the water source and push water up to the surface. They are commonly used in wells or boreholes. On the other hand, surface pumps are placed above the water source and physically pull water from the ground. They are often used in rivers, lakes, or ponds. Both types of pumps are powered by solar energy and are suitable for off-grid irrigation systems.</p></p>
