<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydraulic Screen Changers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Discontinuous Type</li><li>Continuous Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Hydraulic screen changers are devices used in plastic extrusion processes to remove impurities and filter the melted plastic. Discontinuous type screen changers are manually operated and require stopping the extrusion process for screen changing, resulting in production downtime. Continuous type screen changers, on the other hand, allow for uninterrupted extrusion as they feature multiple screens that can be shifted without stopping the process. These devices are widely used in industries where continuous production is necessary to achieve higher efficiency and productivity.</p></p>
