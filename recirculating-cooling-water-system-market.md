<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Recirculating Cooling Water System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Recirculating Cooling Systems</li><li>Closed Recirculating Cooling Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Open recirculating cooling systems are a type of cooling water system that continuously circulates water from a cooling tower to remove heat from industrial processes. This water is then discharged back into a water source such as a river or lake after cooling. Closed recirculating cooling systems, on the other hand, use a closed loop to circulate water, preventing its release into the environment. These systems are more environmentally friendly as they minimize water usage and reduce the risk of contamination. Both types of systems are used in various industries for cooling purposes.</p></p>
