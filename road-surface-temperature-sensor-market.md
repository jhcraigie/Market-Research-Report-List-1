<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Road Surface Temperature Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Road Surface Temperature Sensor market can be divided into two types: Active and Passive. Active sensors use their own energy source to measure the temperature of road surfaces. These sensors emit energy, such as infrared radiation, and measure the energy that is reflected back to determine the temperature. In contrast, passive sensors rely on ambient energy sources, like sunlight, to measure the temperature. They detect the natural radiation emitted by the road surface and analyze this information to determine the surface temperature.</p></p>
