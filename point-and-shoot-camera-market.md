<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Point-and-shoot Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CCD Sensor</li><li>CMOS Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The point-and-shoot camera market can be classified into two types based on the sensor technology used: CCD sensor and CMOS sensor. CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) sensors produce high-quality images with low noise and good color accuracy, making them suitable for professional photography. However, they consume more power and are slower in capturing images. On the other hand, CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) sensors are more power-efficient, faster, and have better low-light performance, but they may introduce more noise and have lower color accuracy compared to CCD sensors.</p></p>
