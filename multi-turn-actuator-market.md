<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multi Turn Actuator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electric</li><li>Non-electric</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The multi-turn actuator market can be classified into two main types: electric and non-electric. Electric multi-turn actuators utilize electricity as their power source, usually through motors, to generate the necessary torque for valve or damper opening/closing actions. These actuators are commonly used in industries that require precise and automated control, such as oil and gas or water treatment. On the other hand, non-electric multi-turn actuators operate without electricity and rely on manual or hydraulic mechanisms to perform similar functions. This non-electric variant is typically found in applications where continuous power supply is not available or not viable.</p></p>
