<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electronics Plastic Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Halogenated Type</li><li>Non-halogen Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The electronics plastic market can be categorized into two types based on the presence or absence of halogen compounds. Halogenated type refers to electronic plastics that contain halogen compounds like chlorine or bromine. These plastics have excellent fire-retardant properties but are considered environmentally harmful due to the toxic gases they release when burnt. On the other hand, non-halogen type electronic plastics do not contain halogens and are considered more environmentally friendly. These plastics provide good electrical insulation but have lower fire retardancy compared to halogenated types.</p></p>
