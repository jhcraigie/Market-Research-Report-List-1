<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Beam Smoke Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reflective</li><li>Projected</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Beam Smoke Detectors market consists of two main types: Reflective and Projected detectors. Reflective detectors emit a beam of light that reflects off a mirror and onto a receiver, triggering an alarm when smoke disrupts the reflection. Projected detectors emit a beam of light that is directly projected onto a receiver, and an alarm is activated if smoke obstructs the beam. These detectors are widely used in commercial buildings, warehouses, and areas with high ceilings, providing efficient smoke detection and alarm systems.</p></p>
