<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Drainage Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Drainage Devices</li><li>Passive Drainage Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surgical drainage devices are commonly used in medical procedures to drain fluid or air from surgical sites. Active drainage devices are equipped with an external suction system that actively removes fluid or air through negative pressure. On the other hand, passive drainage devices rely on gravity or capillary action to facilitate fluid or air drainage without any external suction. Both types of devices serve the purpose of preventing potential complications such as infections or abscesses by effectively removing unwanted fluids or air from the surgical site.</p></p>
