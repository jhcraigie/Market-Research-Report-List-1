<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vortex Tube Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Uncooled (Adiabatic)</li><li>Cooled (Nonadiabatic)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Vortex Tube Market comprises two main types: Uncooled (Adiabatic) and Cooled (Nonadiabatic). The Uncooled Vortex Tube is designed to cool air without the need for external cooling, making it ideal for applications where there are space or power constraints. On the other hand, the Cooled Vortex Tube uses an external source of cooling to enhance its cooling capabilities, making it suitable for applications requiring lower temperatures or higher cooling efficiencies. Both types provide effective air cooling solutions, but the Cooled Vortex Tube offers superior performance in terms of cooling capacity and efficiency.</p></p>
