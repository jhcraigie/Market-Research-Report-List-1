<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Plastic Parts Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Primer</li><li>Base Coat</li><li>Clearcoat</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive plastic parts coatings are divided into three main types: primer, base coat, and clearcoat. Primers are applied first to enhance adhesion of the coating to the plastic surface. Base coats provide color and appearance, while clearcoats offer protection and glossiness. Each type serves a specific purpose in the coating process, with primers preparing the surface, base coats providing aesthetics, and clearcoats offering durability and shine. Together, these three types of coatings work harmoniously to protect and enhance the appearance of automotive plastic parts.</p></p>
