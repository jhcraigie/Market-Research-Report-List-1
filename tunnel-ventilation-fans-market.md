<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tunnel Ventilation Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Fans</li><li>Jet Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tunnel ventilation fans refer to the fans that are used for providing adequate air circulation in tunnels to ensure safety and comfort. There are two main types of tunnel ventilation fans: Axial Fans and Jet Fans. Axial fans are specially designed to move large volumes of air at low pressure, typically used in long tunnels. On the other hand, Jet fans produce high-velocity airflow, suitable for tunnels with limited space, as they can effectively distribute air in a controlled manner with minimal pressure loss. Both types of fans play a vital role in maintaining proper ventilation in tunnels.</p></p>
